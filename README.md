CoolFace Serialization
======================

CFS is a serialization format that uses human-readable text to transmit key=)value pairs. The primary purpose is for passing large data sets between applications, but is not limited, and can be utilized in place of XML or JSON.

CFS is not bound to any particular language, however, in order for a language to use CFS must have both a parser and encoder for transmission.

CFS files are distinguished by the {{.cool}} file extension.
